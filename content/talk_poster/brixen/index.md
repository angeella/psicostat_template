abstract: In a famous essay, the philosopher Jhon Locke believed that the sensible ideas produced by any object in different men's minds are most commonly very near and indiscernibly alike. The neuroscience tries to prove it by multi-subject fMRI studies. However, the anatomical and functional structure varies across subjects. Hence the image alignment is a fundamental step. The anatomical alignment, e.g. Talaraich space, doesn't account for functional topography. Thus, Haxby et al. (2011) developed a functional approach called Hyperalignment, using orthogonal transformations. The inter-subject classification of functional response improved; however, the Hyperalignment method is entirely anatomy free. This contribution aims to strengthen the Hyperalignment technique, exploiting not only the functional features of the brain but also the anatomical ones. For that, we redefine the functional alignment problem as a statistical model to find the optimal orthogonal matrix transformation. It follows the idea that spatially close voxels must be associated with similar values of the orthogonal matrix transformation. Then, the estimation step uses the spatial information of the voxels. The application to several datasets shows that the proposed method improves the between-subject classification accuracy in the object recognition visual and time segment analysis, compared to the anatomical alignment and the Hyperalignment methods. To sum up, anatomical features of the brain are fundamental in the functional alignment problem of fMRI images.
