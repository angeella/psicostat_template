abstract: Prosody comprehension deficits have been reported in major psychoses. It is still not clear whether these deficits occur at early psychosis stages. The aims of our study were to investigate the linguistic and emotional prosody comprehension abilities in First Episode Psychosis patients compared to healthy controls, the performance differences between non-affective and affective patients, and association between symptoms severity and prosodic features.
