I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova [Cycle XXXIII](https://www.stat.unipd.it/ricerca/cicli-attivi). I am working with Professor [Livio Finos](http://livioivil.github.io/) about statistical methods that can improve the analysis in the Neuroscience field. Mainly, my interest is to connect the psychological and statistical areas to improve both aspects. For that, I am a member of the [Psicostat](http://ip146179.psy.unipd.it/psicostat/web/) group at the University of Padua.

A first project is about a spatial regularization of the Procrustes method used in the alignment of brain data coming from different subjects. I am collaborating with Professor [James Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/jim.html) from the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College and with the  [Haxby Lab](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/index.html).

Another project is about a permutation approach to the [All Resolution Inference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381191830675X) under also the supervision of Professor [Jelle Goeman](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jelle-goeman#tab-1) from the department of Biomedical Data Sciences and Professor [Wouter Weeda](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/wouter-weeda#tab-1) from the department of Psychology at Leiden University.
