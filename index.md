# How to create your website?

In my [short introduction](https://github.com/filippogambarota/hugo_tutorial) to Hugo and Academic Theme I suggested to use the **Blogdown** package for creating the website from scratch. In this case we start from a custom template so we need a different approach.

## What we need?

* GIT and Hugo installed on the PC
* A Github account
* RStudio with the Blogdown package or another IDE (VSCode highly recommended)
